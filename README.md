Simple Banking Management System
This is a simple banking management system implemented in Python. It allows users to perform various banking operations, including creating accounts, depositing, withdrawing, checking balances, and more.

Account Class
The Account class represents a bank account with attributes such as account number, account holder name, account type (current or savings), and balance.

Functionalities
Create Account: Users can create a new bank account by providing account details.
Deposit Amount: Users can deposit money into their accounts.
Withdraw Amount: Users can withdraw money from their accounts.
Balance Enquiry: Users can check their account balance.
Display All Accounts: The program can display all existing account holders' information.
Close an Account: Users can close their account.
Update Account: Users can modify account details like account holder name, type, and balance.
Usage
Run the script to start the Banking Management System.
Choose from the main menu (options 1 to 7) to perform different banking operations.
You can create, modify, deposit, withdraw, or close accounts as needed.
The program also displays colorful ellipses using the Turtle graphics library for a visually pleasing exit screen.
Note
This is a basic implementation of a banking management system for learning purposes. In a real-world scenario, more robust features like authentication, database integration, transaction tracking, and error handling would be necessary.
